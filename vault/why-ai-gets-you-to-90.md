# Prompt Inflation

## Draft 1

---

Claude Code is gut-wrenchingly good. If you're not using it (or similar), stop reading these words right now and go try it. Bye.

Still here? Either you're converted or you're the kind of person who doesn't do what they're told. Either way, we can continue.

But how much are the productivity gains? Twitter / LinkedIn / everyone in San Francisco seems to have strong opinions that it's a large number followed by an "x".

Is it 1.1x, 2x, 10x or 100x?

### Diminishing Returns of Progress

Imagine you're building a Lego tower. You place the second brick and it's satisfying - you've just doubled what you've built. By brick 100, you're adding 1%. Same effort, fraction of the dopamine. Early progress is intoxicating. Late progress is a grind.

What's more - you prioritise the impactful stuff first... Obviously! However, that implies that the more you work, the less important each next task is.

This doesn't mean the final 1% isn't important or even essential. If you're building a rocket, 99% of the engineering might be done. But if the last 1% is "the bit that stops it exploding," don't let Katy Perry on board just yet.

### A World Without Tolkein

Let's say you're using Claude to write some fantasy novels.

Your first prompt:

> Write me a fantasy story. Main character's called Frodo - Small guy, big quest, evil ring. Throw in some walking trees and some really big battles. Three books, 400 pages each.

Congratulations, you've written a trilogy. Well, you haven't - you've described one and the AI has hallucinated something that structurally resembles one. But emotionally? You've written a trilogy. Your productivity was wild - 100x? 1000x? It doesn't have to be exact - just post about it on social media ASAP.

Many prompts later:

> In chapter 5, introduce a character called Tom Bombadil. Make him as boring and pointless to the storyline as possible. Really lean into it. Ideally looking to lose about 30% of readers - the ones who were only reading for plot. They weren't your real fans anyway.

Many, many prompts later:

> When Sam says "I can't carry the ring, but I can carry you" — can we try "I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you"? Actually that's worse. Go back. But maybe italicise "you"?

### The 90% Problem

These concepts compound. The longer you work on a thing, the more time you're tweaking, the less value you're delivering. Call it Prompt Inflation. The more mature your project, the more prompts you spend for smaller gains.

And it applies at every scale. Netflix in 2016 was scaling to feed the demand of a global audience. In 2026 it's improving the "skip recap" button and keeping the lights on. This is no slight on Netflix. It's just that tech is no longer their edge as each new improvement is marginal. Content has become their real edge.

At the other end of the spectrum, a small task adding some basic if/else logic? The AI probably does it first time. But you've still got to test, review, deploy, monitor, update docs and communicate the change with customers.

## Keep getting more productive

**Invest in your AI skill**

Invest your time in AI tools. Here's how I try to think about it:

- If you could do something with AI, but you think you'd be quicker old-schooling it - Battle that instinct as much as you possibly can. You'll be slower at first. Then you won't be.
- Spend a MINIMUM of 1 hour per day specifically upskilling / improving your setup. It will be worth it.
- Religiously update your claude.md's every time Claude misunderstands you.

The productivity gains come fast and you can hold me to that.

**Feedback loop**

For Claude to truly be 100x and above, you need 2 things: A clear **objective** and a **metric** the AI can use to iteratively get there. If you ever find yourself being more of a QA for an AI it's because the AI doesn't know what "done" is, Or doesn't know how to verify it.

For example, go from:
>Build me a web based game similar to Space Invaders.

To: 
>Build me a web based game similar to Space Invaders. Use https://freeinvaders.org/ as a template. Keep iterating until you have reached a passable first version where user can use keys + spacebar to shoot aliens. Use Claude in chrome to run it yourself and verify it is done.

The result of this prompt is really, really, really quite impressive.

**Leverage yourself**

If you've got the AI iterating, it's likely going to be working independently for 10+ minutes.

This allows you to work in parallel. Kick off a task, let it run and come back to it. Have 10 of them going. If you ever find yourself waiting for an AI to respond you're wasting time.

Working in parallel is going to feel strange. Software Engineering advice up until now has always been about preventing context switching and getting in "flow". Now I'm advocating the opposite.

It's a new uncomfortable way of working... But there's a lot of upside for those willing to embrace it and there'll be no mercy for those left behind.

### The Final 10%

All of the above will make you faster. Maybe 100x faster. But Prompt Inflation lingers like the ending of Return of the King. 

Diminishing returns are a ratio, so the last 10% still feels just as painful relative to everything before it. You may get to brick 99 quicker. But brick 100 still takes the same disproportionate effort.

And if you've taken the parallel work seriously, you now have ten projects at 90%. There's no way around the final 10% - only to grind through it.
