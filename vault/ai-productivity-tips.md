**Invest in your AI skill**

Invest your time in AI tools. Here's how I try to think about it:

- If you could do something with AI, but you think you'd be quicker old-schooling it - Battle that instinct as much as you possibly can. You'll be slower at first. Then you won't be.
- Spend a MINIMUM of 1 hour per day specifically upskilling / improving your setup. It will be worth it.
- Religiously update your claude.md's every time Claude misunderstands you.

The productivity gains come fast and you can hold me to that.

**Feedback loop**

For Claude to truly be 100x and above, you need 2 things: A clear **objective** and a **metric** the AI can use to iteratively get there. If you ever find yourself being more of a QA for an AI it's because the AI doesn't know what "done" is, Or doesn't know how to verify it.

For example, go from:
>Build me a web based game similar to Space Invaders.

To:
>Build me a web based game similar to Space Invaders. Use https://freeinvaders.org/ as a template. Keep iterating until you have reached a passable first version where user can use keys + spacebar to shoot aliens. Use Claude in chrome to run it yourself and verify it is done.

**Leverage yourself**

If you've got the AI iterating, it's likely going to be working independently for 10+ minutes.

This allows you to work in parallel. Kick off a task, let it run and come back to it. Have 10 of them going. If you ever find yourself waiting for an AI to respond you're wasting time.

Working in parallel is going to feel strange. Software Engineering advice up until now has always been about preventing context switching and getting in "flow". Now I'm advocating the opposite.

It's a new uncomfortable way of working... But there's a lot of upside for those willing to embrace it and there'll be no mercy for those left behind.
