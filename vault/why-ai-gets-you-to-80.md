# Why AI Gets You to 80%

## Draft 1

---

Claude Code is gut-wrenchingly good. If you're not using it (or similar), stop reading these words right now and go try it. Bye.

Still here? Either you're converted or you're the kind of person who doesn't do what they're told. Either way, we can continue.

But how much are the productivity gains? Twitter / LinkedIn / everyone in San Francisco seems to have to have VERY strong opinions that it's a large number followed by an "x".

Is it 1.1x, 2x, 10x or 100x? They're all kind of right - and here's why...

### Impact Decay

Imagine you're building a Lego tower. You place the second brick and it's satisfying - you've just doubled what you've built. By brick 100, you're adding 1%. Same effort, fraction of the dopamine. Early progress is intoxicating. Late progress is a grind.

What's more - you prioritise the impactful stuff first... Obviously! However, that implies that the more you work, the less important each next task is.

This is Impact Decay. Diminishing returns on progress.

This doesn't mean the final 1% isn't important or even essential. If you're building a rocket - 99% of the engineering might be done, but if the last 1% is "the bit that stops it exploding," don't let Katy Perry on board just yet.

### Prompt Inflation

Let's say you're using Claude to write some fantasy novels.

Your first prompt:

> Write me a fantasy story. Main character's called Frodo - Small guy, big quest, evil ring. Throw in some walking trees and some really big battles. Three books, 400 pages each.

Congratulations, you've written a trilogy. Well, you haven't - you've described one and the AI has hallucinated something that structurally resembles one. But emotionally? You've written a trilogy. Your productivity was wild - 100x? 1000x? It doesn't have to be exact - just post about it on social media ASAP.

Many prompts later:

> In chapter 5, introduce a character called Tom Bombadil. Make him as boring and pointless to the storyline as possible. Really lean into it. Ideally looking to lose about 30% of readers - the ones who were only reading for plot. They weren't your real fans anyway.

Many, many prompts later:

> When Sam says "I can't carry the ring, but I can carry you" — can we try "I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you"? Actually that's worse. Go back. But maybe italicise "you"?

This is Prompt Inflation. As your project matures, you spend more prompts for smaller gains.

And it applies at every scale. Greenfield app? First prompt writes the skeleton. Tiny feature on a massive codebase? First prompt still gets you 80%.

### The 80% Problem

Neither of these concepts are new. Claude Code has just collapsed the early phase so completely that the late phase is now most of the job. The 80% still happens. You just don't experience it anymore.
