# Why AI Gets You to 80%

## Draft 1

---

When it comes to Claude Code, the hype really does match the reality. If you're not using it (or similar), stop reading these words right now and go and start using it. Bye.

But is it 1.1x, 2x, 10x or 100x?

It's all of the above. And here's why.

### Impact Erosion

Imagine you're building a Lego tower. You place the second brick and it's satisfying - you've just doubled what you've built. By brick 100, you're adding 1%. Same effort, fraction of the dopamine.

This is how all complex work feels. Early progress is intoxicating. Late progress is invisible. And it's not just perception - the impact genuinely does erode over time.

Teams prioritise. They do the important stuff first, which is correct, but it also means that by month six you're working on things that matter less than what you shipped in week one. Netflix in 2012 was solving "how do we stream video to millions of people globally." Netflix in 2024 is solving "should the skip intro button appear 0.3 seconds earlier." Both problems are real. One of them built a company.

This is Impact Erosion. Your work has less impact over time - both because it feels that way and because it is that way. The two compound.

### Macro to Micro

Here's where AI enters.

Let's say you're using Claude to write a fantasy novel.

Your first prompt:

> Write a fantasy story about a "hobbit" called Frodo. He finds a ring and is tasked with delivering it to a volcano in a distant land called "Mordor" where the main antagonist, Sauron, is gathering his strength. Three books, 300-400 pages each.

Congratulations, you've written a trilogy. Your productivity just went through the roof - 100x? 1000x? Hard to measure something that used to be impossible.

A few prompts later:

> Book 3 concludes with Frodo throwing the ring into Mount Doom with Sam's help. Meanwhile, the defenders of Gondor distract Sauron with large battles.

Still fast, still impressive. You're shaping something.

Many prompts later:

> In chapter 5, introduce a character called Tom Bombadil. Make him as boring and pointless to the storyline as possible. Ideally looking to lose about 30% of readers at this point.

You're debugging now. You're in the weeds.

Many, many prompts later:

> Book 3, chapter 9, page 247. When Frodo and Sam are on Mount Doom, Frodo should say: "I am glad you are here with me. Here at the end of all things, Sam."

Your productivity gain? Maybe 1.1x. You're tweaking words and the AI is waiting for you to know what you want.

This is Macro to Micro. Early work is generative - you're building worlds. Late work is surgical - you're choosing words. AI is exceptional at the macro. At the micro, it's waiting for instructions that take you just as long to write as the thing itself.

### The 80% Problem

Put these together. Impact Erosion means your early work matters more. Macro to Micro means AI supercharges exactly that phase.

So you get to 80% fast - terrifyingly fast. The demos aren't lying.

Then you spend the next six months on the remaining 20%. The part where you need to know what you actually want. The part where the prompts get longer than the output. The part where you're staring at the screen wondering if "here at the end of all things" should have a comma.

AI gets you to 80%. The 80% was never the hard part.

## Notes

- Consider cutting the Netflix example if it feels like a detour
- "The 80% was never the hard part" - this is the landing. Make sure it hits.
- Tom Bombadil line works. Don't overthink it.
