# Why AI Gets You to 80%

## Draft 1

When it comes to Claude Code, the hype matches the reality. If you're not using it (or similar), stop reading these words right now and go and start using it. Bye.

Still here? Good. Either you're already converted or you're the kind of person who doesn't do what they're told. Either way, we can continue.

What are the productivity gains? Is it 1.1x, 100x? EveryTwitter / LinkedIn / San Fran

1.1x, 2x, 10x or 100x? It's all of the above and here's why...

### Impact Decay

Imagine you're building a Lego tower. You place the second brick and it's satisfying - you've just doubled what you've built. By brick 100, you're adding 1%. Same effort, fraction of the dopamine.

This is how all complex work feels. Early progress is intoxicating. Late progress feels invisible. And it's not just in your head - you prioritise the important stuff first, so later work genuinely matters less.

This is Impact Decay. Diminishing returns on both perceived progress and impact. Your work matters less over time, and it feels even worse than it is.

This doesn't mean the final 1% isn't important or even essential. It's like building a rocket - 99% of the engineering might be done, but if the last 1% is "the bit that stops it exploding," don't let Katy Perry on just yet.

### Macro to Micro

Here's where AI enters.

Let's say you're using Claude to write a fantasy novel.

Your first prompt:

> Write a fantasy story about a "hobbit" called Frodo. He finds a ring and is tasked with delivering it to a volcano in a distant land called "Mordor" where the main antagonist, Sauron, is gathering his strength. Three books, 300-400 pages each.

Congratulations, you've written a trilogy. Well, you haven't - you've described one and the AI has hallucinated something that structurally resembles one. But emotionally? You've written a trilogy. Your productivity just went through the roof - 100x? 1000x? Hard to measure something that used to be impossible.

A few prompts later:

> Book 3 concludes with Frodo throwing the ring into Mount Doom with Sam's help. Meanwhile, the defenders of Gondor distract Sauron with large battles.

Still fast, still impressive. Productivity definitely feels in the high-double-digit-Xs.

Many prompts later:

> In chapter 5, introduce a character called Tom Bombadil. Make him as boring and pointless to the storyline as possible. Really lean into it. Ideally looking to lose about 30% of readers - the ones who were only reading for plot. They weren't your real fans anyway.

You're debugging now. You're in the weeds.

Many, many prompts later:

> Book 3, chapter 9, page 247. When Frodo and Sam are on Mount Doom, Frodo should say: "I am glad you are here with me. Here at the end of all things, Sam."

Your productivity gain? Maybe 1.1x. You're tweaking words and the AI is waiting for you to know what you want.

This is Macro to Micro. Early work is generative - you're building worlds. Late work is surgical - you're tweaking and perfecting. AI is good at both but as your project matures you spend more time prompting for smaller improvements.

### The 80% Problem

Putting these together. Impact Decay means your early work matters more. Macro to Micro means AI supercharges exactly that phase. So you get to 80% fast - terrifyingly fast.

Then you spend the next six months on the remaining 20%. The part where you need to know what you actually want. The part where the prompts get longer than the output. The part where you're staring at the screen wondering if "here at the end of all things" should have a comma.

AI gets you to 80%. The 80% was never the hard part.

## Notes

- Consider cutting the Netflix example if it feels like a detour
- "The 80% was never the hard part" - this is the landing. Make sure it hits.
- Tom Bombadil line works. Don't overthink it.
