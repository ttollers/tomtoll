## Source code for tomtoll.com

This site is to document some of the technical challenges I come up against and how I've solved them.

### Feedback
I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't solicit some feedback:
- If there's an error, please create an issue on github here: https://github.com/ttollers/tomtoll/issues/new
- If you disagree, let me know on [https://twitter.com/tomtoll_eth/status/1592907007001956352?s=20](twitter)

Strong opinions, weakly held and all that...
