I've had many "hands off" managers in my career.
Some of them were great, some of them less so. None of them truly understood the deicisons I was making or the work I was doing.

This matters because without deeply understanding the trade offs that your team(s) are making, you cannot do some of the critical parts of leaderhship.
You cannot:

1. Hold your team to account
2. Help the wider business understand the impact of your teams
3. Ensure teams are focused on the right things for the business

We're agreed it's important. So what is "enough"?

I want to create a simple rule of thumb for the following problem...

> What is the minimumu level of understanding of the technology that a leader needs to have in order to be effective?

My new mental model for this is the "Turing Complete Understanding". I.e...

## Turing Complete Understanding
> The minimum level of understanding to (just about) be able to do the job if you had to.

_I realise that this is a bit of a stretch of the term "Turing Complete"._
