title: Strong opinions, weakly held

description: You've probably encountered the self-rating section if you've ever written a CV. You know the one - it's where you judge yourself on a scale of one to five for each skill you possess. But before you go ahead and give yourself all the stars, let's get into your future employers' shoes and talk about the Dunning-Kruger effect.

Keeping an open mind to other people’s perspectives is a critical yet under utilised skill.
The divisiveness spreading across society could be done a world of good by a few more people doing this.

But it’s not just at the societal level it causes issues.

Ever had a row with a partner where you know you’re in the wrong but you’re just bring yourself to admit?

Perhaps you’ve disagreed with a colleague on something to the point where it got heated

Flat Earthers won’t listen if you show them incontrovertible proof that the world is round. They’d tell you about conspiracies and flawed evidence. Nothing you do or say will change their mind. It’s an unshakeable belief that has become part of their identity. 

Even more potent than identity, it’s become something that binds a community. Community is more important than truth.

I don’t begrudge them of this. It’s no more outlandish than God creating the world in 7 days or our souls beginning a new life in another body when we die.

Politics is on the same spectrum. How often have you persuaded someone of an opposing political ideal to your way of thinking? You likely hold similar political views to your friends and family, which is very natural.

Identity and belonging are amazingly powerful and positive forces. From the [community spirit of Football](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14674086/)... To the inspiring cultures we see throughout the world. There’s no doubt that the bond of community and identity can be much stronger then what is “right”.

Of course, It can also be toxic and divisive. Think [White Supremecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_hooliganism](football hooliganism).

It can also lead to poor decision making. Think [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit](Brexit) (sorry-not-sorry for being a hypocrite on this one).

How do we keep the good but eliminate the bad? By deeply listening, understanding and empathising with  being self-aware of ignorance and

Further down the spectrum, you’ll find loads of other identity-based divides. Are you Apple of Android? Vim or Emacs? Manchester Utd or Liverpool? Boiled egg up or down?

In the Software Engineering world, what programming language, database and even what cloud architecture you use are all impacted by this phenomenon.

And then there’s Crypto. There are [https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterizzo/2022/08/25/how-to-be-a-bitcoin-maximalist/?sh=d1299d170364](pro-crypto) and [https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/30/elizabeth-warren-is-building-an-anti-crypto-army-feeding-serious-us-bitcoin-ban-warnings/?sh=4a84ca3f71f6](anti-crypto) movements.

Partisan views don’t take much to be shaped. I get the feeling that the author in [https://on.ft.com/3VccxkZ](this FT article) has become more anti-crypto every time she gets “heckled” on the topic. The more she has to defend her position, the more it becomes a part of who she is. I’d probably be the same

She’s probably unaware that crypto crime, while on the rise, [https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2023-crypto-crime-report-introduction/](is very low as a total percentage). On the other hand, it’s estimated to be between [unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html] 2% and 5% for traditional currencies.

Crypto has been a big part of my life since 2018. It is my opinion that it will be a net social good. However, it’s too early to know for sure. I will try not to cling to this belief beyond what is sensible. 

Opinions are good. They drive decision-making. They make us interesting. They help us think. However, too often, they’re formed out of ignorance and become something we no longer control.

From the smallest every day decision, to big **, identity based opinions cause worse decision making and divisiveness.

Have opinions… But try to be self-aware of your ignorance and bias and be ready to drop them if you see a better way.

Make strong opinions, weakly held part of your identity instead.
