Giving "difficult" feedback is hard.
There's enough content on them already so I won't shill them here.

Giving "difficult" feedback is hard and often complicated by the potential for defensiveness.
Frameworks like COIN, BOOST, FAST, STAR, and BID (sound more like crypto projects) help structure conversations.
There's enought content on them already (and the sound more like crypto projects).
I won't be shilling them here.

Instead, I'll explore actionable methods to sidestep defensiveness by creating what I call "Bidrectional Empathy".
This will help transform feedback into a constructive, even enjoyable, process.

### The Problem with Defensiveness

Someone who is defensive will not listen and take onboard your feedback.
It could also damage your relationship with them.
Once the shield is up, it's very difficult to bring it down again.

To avoid defensiveness, you must show the other person you have listened, that you care and that you want them to succeed.
In other words, you need to generate empathy in them **towards you**.

### Bidirectional Empathy
'Bidirectional Empathy' is a term I've coined to underscore the necessity of mutual understanding in feedback.
It's about more than walking a mile in their shoes; it's inviting them to do the same with yours.

This second part is critical and often forgotten.
When giving feedback, you cannot rely on the recipient to instinctively understand your perspective.
You must take responsibility for helping them understand you.

> Avoiding defensiveness is about building Bidirectional Empathy.

### How to Build Bidirectional Empathy

Let's go through some actionable methods to help build Bidirectional Empathy.
We'll iterate through an example where a fictitious person called Jim has been late.

#### Bad (non empathetic)

> Why are you always late?

Try that out yourself.
It feels quite attacking and something you need to defend.
Let's improve it.

#### Avoid direct "why"

> What often causes you to be late?

A simple one to start. Try to avoid using "why" when questioning behaviour.

The word "why" comes across judgmental and accusatory.
Jim will not be able to see things from your perspective if he feels like he needs to explain himself.

#### Be Specific
> What caused you to be **10 minutes** late **in this morning's team meeting**?

Being specific allows you to separate the action from the person.
You're talking about something Jim did (he was late) rather than who he is (a person who is late).

Specific feedback is also more objective.
Jim often being late is a judgement.
Jim being late for a meeting that morning is a fact.

#### Impact from Jim's Perspective
> This morning you were 10 minutes late for the team meeting...
> **Making others wait for you implies you value your time more than theirs.**

It's important to highlight that impact is most powerful when framed from the perspective of the recipient.
In other words, make sure you talk about how Jim's actions impacts what **Jim** cares about...
Not what you care about (or think he should!).

For example, another impact of being late is that it wastes company time.
However, Jim will likely care much more about disrespecting his colleagues.
The more you understand what drives Jim in advance, the easier this is.

#### Impact Gap
> **Your contributions in meetings are insightful and highly valued.**
> However, this morning you were 10 minutes late to the team meeting.
> Making others wait for you implies you value your time more than theirs.

We've already highlighted the negative impact of Jim's behaviour.
This time, we do the opposite - we show Jim what **could be** if he changed his behaviour.

The difference between what **could be** and **what is** is what I call the 'Impact Gap'.
This is much more powerful than the negative impact alone and puts a positive twist on the conversation.
As before, it should be framed about what Jim cares about - not you!

#### Change the perspective
> Your contributions in meetings are insightful and highly valued.
> However, this morning you were 10 minutes late to the team meeting.
> **Can you see how** making others wait for you implies you value your time more than theirs?

This is my favourite part and the crux of this post.
It forces Jim to answer from your perspective rather than his own.
This helps Jim build empathy towards your point of view.

#### Don't give all the answers
> Your contributions in meetings are insightful and highly valued.
> However, this morning you were 10 minutes late to the team meeting.
> Can you see how being late **causes your colleagues to feel disrespected and devalues your contributions?**

This is getting more advanced now!
We've given a start action (being late) and an outcome (disrespected and devalued contributions) and not directly explained the connection.
We've then asked Jim to think about this connection for himself.

This creates a great backdrop for a conversation where Jim is forced to think empathetically about how his actions impact others.
You know you're on the right track when it feels like Jim is giving feedback to himself.

## Extending the Concept: More Real-World Examples
The example above is contrived to help illustrate the point.
In reality, things are much more complex and nuanced.
In fact, I find a lot of advice on feedback to be like this: simple when read in a blog post, but much harder to apply in real life.

The best I can do is go through some more examples.

#### Performance Drop
**Bad:**
> Why has your performance dropped?

**Better:**
> When you're engaged, you are one of our best performers.
> However, I noticed that ticket X took 3 days longer than I'd expect and you were very unresponsive in Slack.
> Can you see how this makes me feel like you're not as engaged as you used to be.

Of course, this is a difficult topic and I've simplified it a lot.

In these situations, it's even more important to separate actions from identity.
Questioning a person's work ethic attacks them at their very core.
Instead, using a phrase like "not as engaged" makes it much easier to talk objectively.
Few people consider "engagement" core to their identity.

#### Camera on in meetings
**Bad:**
> Why do you never have your camera on?

**Better:**
> In the meeting just now your camera was switched off.
> I believe that having cameras on is important in remote environments.
> Can you tell me why I feel so strongly about this?

Here, you're asking Jim to repeat back your perspective on the importance of cameras.
You haven't given him the answers.
You're asking him to give you a thoughtful response about why cameras are important to you.

Also note the distinction between "can you see" and "can you tell me".
You can't just answer "yes" or "no" to the latter.
Open questions are generally preferable.

Lastly, It's not always bad to use "why".
In the "Bad" case, it's directly questioning the person's actions.
In the "Better" case, it's asking the person to question YOUR view of the world.

#### Rogue Engineer
**Bad:**
> Why did you refactor that code without consulting the team?

**Better:**
> You have a great eye for code quality and the team really values your expertise.
> However, when you went ahead and refactored part z of the codebase without consulting anyone, it undermined the work that was already there.
> Can you see how the refactor made things worse for the team who don't understand why the change was needed?

Very often, people are not aware of the impact of their actions on others.
If they think they're doing the right thing, they'll be much more likely to get defensive when you suggest otherwise.

In these situations it's even more important that you help them make the connection themselves.

### Finishing up...

Avoiding defensiveness is just one piece of the feedback puzzle.
However, it's a pivotal piece.
It has held me back from giving feedback in the past and I hope this post can help you avoid the same.

PLEASE share your own experiences with defensiveness or perhaps give me some feedback on this post!
But remember, if you make me defensive, you've failed ðŸ˜œ.
