Giving "difficult" feedback is hard.
There's plenty of frameworks out there like COIN, BOOST, FAST, STAR and BID that help structure conversations (they sound more like crypto projects).
There's enough content on them already and I often find them too prescriptive.
I won't be shilling them in this post.

Instead this post will focus on what's often held me back in the past... The fear of making someone defensive.

Making someone defensive means they haven't truly heard you and so are unlikely to change their behaviour.

> When giving difficult feedback, if you make someone defensive, you've failed.

To avoid defensiveness, you must show the other person you have **listened**, that you **care** and you **want them to succeed**.
In other words, you need to create empathy between the two of you.

### Creating Empathy

Empathy bridges understanding.
Itâ€™s not just about you walking a mile in their shoes but inviting them to do the same.
This second part is critical and often forgotten in feedback conversations.

> Avoiding defensiveness is about building bi-directional empathy.

Let's go through some actionable methods I use to help others see things from my perspective.
To help demonstrate, we'll iterate through a simple example where a fictious person called Jim has been late.

##### Bad (non empathetic)

> Why are you always late?

Try that out on yourself.
It feels quite attacking and something you need to justify... To defend.
Let's improve it.

##### Avoid direct "why"

> What's causes you to be always late?

A simple one to start. Try to avoid using "why" when questioning Jim's behaviour.

The word "Why" comes across judgemental and accusatory.
People will not be able to see things from your perspective if they feel like they're being attacked.

##### Be Specific
> What caused you to be **10 minutes** late **in this morning's standup**?

Being Specific allows you to separate the action from the person.
You're talking about something Jim did (he was late) rather than who he is (a person who is late).

Specific feedback is easier to talk objectively about.

##### Impact
> This morning you were 10 minutes late for standup.
> ~It's a big waste of company time~ **It implies you value your time more than the rest of the team.**

Helping Jim understand the impact of his actions is crucial to feedback and a much bigger topic than I can cover here.

However, it's important to highlight that (like everything in this post) impact is most powerful when framed from the perspective of the recipient.
In other words, make sure you talk about how Jim's actions impacts what **Jim** cares about... Not you.

I've highlighted this with the strikethrough in the example.
Jim will likely care more about disrepecting his colleagues than wasting company time.

##### Change the perspective
> This morning you were 10 minutes late for standup.
> It implies you value your time more than the rest of the team. **Can you see how it comes across that way?**

This is my favourite part and the crux of the whole post.
It forces Jim to answer from your perspective rather than his own.
This helps Jim build empathy towards your point of view.

##### Impact Gap
> **Your contributions in meetings are insightful and highly valued by me and the team.**
> However, this morning you were 10 minutes late.
> It implies you value your time more than the rest of the team.
> Can you see how it comes across that way?

We've already highlighted the (negative) impact of Jim's behvaiour.
This time, we do the opposite - we want to show Jim what could be so Jim can see the impact gap between the two.
The impact gap is much more powerful than just the negative impact on its own.

As before, it should be framed about what Jim cares about - not you!
This maximises how Jim's behaviour impacts something he cares about.

##### Don't give all the answers
> Your contributions in meetings are insightful and highly valued by me and the team.
> However, this morning you were 10 minutes late.
> It implies you value your time more than the rest of the team.
> Can you see how being late **causes your colleagues to feel direspected and devalues your contributions?**

This is getting more advanced now!
We've given a start action (being late) and an outcome (devalued contributions) and not directly explained the connection.
We've then asked Jim to think about this connection for himself.

This creates a great backdrop to a conversation where Jim is forced to think from another's perspective and make connections himself.

## More examples
The example above is contrived to help illustrate the point.
In reality, things are much more complex and nuanced.

Here are some more (still greatly simplified) examples using some of the same ideas.

##### Performance
**Bad:**
> Why has your performance dropped?

**Better:**
> When you're engaged, you are one of our best performers.
> However, I noticed that ticket X took 3 days longer than I'd expect and you were very unresponsive in Slack.
> Can you see how this makes me feel like you're not as engaged as you used to be.

Of course, this is a difficult topic and I've simplified it A LOT.
However, I hope it illustrates the point.

In these situations, it's even more important to separate actions from identity.
Questioning work ethic attacks a person at their very core.
Instead, using a phrase like "not as engaged" makes it much easier to talk objectively.
Few people consider "engagement" core to their identity.

##### Camera on in meetings
**Bad:**
> Why do you never have your camera on?

**Better:**
> In the meeting just now, I noticed you didn't have your camera on.
> Can you tell me why I believe having cameras on is important in remote environments?

Here, Jim has to link the action to the outcome himself.
We don't want to make the connection for him as it means he won't have to think about it and can less thoughtful answers.

Also note the distinction between "can you see" and "can you tell me".
It's harder to just answer "yes" or "no" to the latter!

Lastly, note that it's not always bad to use "why".
In the "Bad" case, it's directly questioning the person's actions.
In the "Better" case, it's asking the person to question YOUR view of the world.

##### Rogue Engineer
**Bad:**
> Why did you refactor that code without consulting the team?

**Better:**
> You have a great eye for code quality and the team really values your expertise.
> However, when you went ahead and refactored part z of the codebase without consulting anyone, it undermined the work that was already there.
> Can you see how the refactor made things worse for the team who don't understand why the change was needed?

Adding this example as it's come up a lot in my career!

### Finishing up...

Avoiding defensiveness is a small piece of the feedback puzzle.
There are a whole bunch of topics that I've not touched upon.
However, worrying about defensiveness has held me back from giving feedback in the past and I hope this post can help you avoid the same.

PLEASE let me know your thoughts on this post.
Espcially if it's "difficult" feedback... But remember, if you make me defensive, you've failed ðŸ˜œ.
