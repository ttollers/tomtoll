This site is to document some of the technical challenges I come up against
and how I've solved them.

### TLDR 
All posts will start with a "TLDR" section. Get the key takeways from the first paragraph

### Opinionated Restraint
While it's difficult to avoid completely, posts should not be overly opionated.

> Moreover, if an opionated statement is going to be made, we'll highlight it like this.

### Links, Links and More Links
Often posts will require a high amount of prerequisite knowledge. Posts will use links liberally
so you can quickly read up on topics you're not familiar on.

### Feedback
I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't solicit some feedback:
- If there's an error, please create an issue on github here: .
- If there's missing content, add to it. 
Make a Pull Request here. (Pull Request Repo todo)

### Always Up to Date
Posts will stay relevant or be deleted. Where possible posts will be updated if new information becomes available.
I'm hoping I won't be the only person doing this!

### Quantity Over Quality
I've typically been a bit of a perfectionist. I don't want this to be the case on this site. If a post in a state
where it can add value, then it will be deployed. They can always be improved!
