I didn't do Computer Science at University.
Sometimes I've felt like I'm not a "real" Software Engineer because of this.
However, I've been fortunate to have worked with some fantastic people who have taught me a lot.

Since I've worked as an Engineer, I've loved every minute.
I find it sad that decisions you make as a teenager mean you miss out on doing something perfect for you.

As a teenager, I wanted to fit in and be popular.
It's funny even to imagine 17-year-old me starting to code.
There was a strong stigma against it.

I did what most privileged and mildly intelligent teenagers did when they could'nt work out what to do with their lives - Economics.

I had an incredible time at University.
However, I left feeling disillusioned by the whole "finance" / "business" thing.

After a year off, I tried sales.
I hated it, and it's given me a huge respect for people who do it.
It's also been handy as an engineer - but that's a post for another day.

I found programming after quitting my sales job to start my own business.
In reality, I didn't start anything - I just got lost in learning to code.

After I ran out of money ~starting my business~ learning to code, it was time to get a job.
My first job was at [Reach PLC](https://www.reachplc.com/).
I was fortunate to join a fantastic team of smart, patient engineers who helped me develop quickly.

This first role is also where I grew a passion for Functional Programming - to the point it became obsessive.

Looking back, I'm incredibly grateful (and they probably don't know it) to those who helped me in that first job.
But, by the time I left (and with hindsight), I'd become a terrible colleague.

I had a strong egotistical need to be the cleverest (I wasn't even close), and I thought I knew everything.

I now know that this was classic Peak Ignorance (see my post on the [Dunning Kruger Effect](/the-dunning-kruger-radar) for context).
Realising this was an important lesson for me.

It was time to move on.
A couple of jobs later, I joined the Blockchain Analytics company [Elliptic](https://www.elliptic.co).
I learned so much there. Especially:
- Functional Programming is fun - but building shit that does stuff is better
- It's better to be the stupidest among geniuses than the cleverest among the ordinary.
- How to manage people who are better (and more qualified) than you

I grew (and shrank) with Elliptic. I got incredible opportunities and will look back at my time there positively.

At the start of 2023, I joined another Crypto startup: [Violet](https://violet.co), as VP of Engineering and later CTO.

In 2024 I joined OFA startup Blink Labs as CTO.
