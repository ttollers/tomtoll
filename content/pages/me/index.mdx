I'm not your average Software Engineer (but who wants to be average anyway?).

I didn't do Computer Science at University.
Sometimes I've felt like I'm not a "real" Software Engineer because of this.
However, I've been fortunate to have worked with some fantastic people who have taught me a lot.

Since I've worked as an Engineer, I've loved every minute.
I find it sad that decisions you make as a teenager mean you miss out on doing something perfect for you.
As a teenager, I wanted to fit in and be popular.
It's funny even to imagine 17 year old starting to code.
There was a strong stigma against it.

I did what every privileged and mildly intelligent teenager does.
Economics.

Long story short, I felt a bit disillusioned by the whole "finance" / "business" thing.
I tried sales for nearly two years.
I bloody hated it, and it's given me respect for people who do it.

It's also been handy as an engineer - but that's a post for another day.

I found programming after quitting my sales job to start my own business.
In reality, I didn't start any business whatsoever.
I just got lost in learning to code.

After I ran out of money ~starting my own business~ learning to code, I realised it was time to get a job.
My first job was at a company called now called [Reach PLC](https://www.reachplc.com/).
I was fortunate to join a fantastic team of smart, patient engineers who helped me develop quickly.

This first role is also where I grew a passion for Functional Programming...
To the point it became obsessive.

Looking back, I'm incredibly grateful (and they probably don't know it) to those who helped me in that first job.

By the time I left (and with hindsight), I was a nightmare to work with.
I had a strong egotistical need to be the cleverest (I wasn't even close).
I thought that I knew everything.
It was definitely Peak Ignorance (see my post on the [Dunning Kruger Effect](/dunning-kruger-effect) for context).
Coming to this conclusion was an important lesson for me - especially when I've seen it in others later in my career.

Anyway, it was time to move on.
A couple of years later, I joined the Blockchain Analytics company [Elliptic](https://www.elliptic.co).
I learned so much there. Especially:
- Functional Programming is fun - but building shit that does stuff is better
- You don't need to be cleverest in the room.
- How to manage people better (and more qualified) than you

I grew (and shrank) with Elliptic. I got incredible opportunities and will look back at my time there positively.

At the start of 2023, I joined another Crypto startup: [https://violet.co](Violet), where I am currently.
