### Strong opinions weakly held
I try to live by this in all parts of my life.
I've even written [/blog/strong-opinions-weakly-held](a post about it).
This means:
- I may express ignorant opinions
- I want to be told when I'm wrong

### Feedback
I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't solicit some feedback:
- If there's an error, please create an issue on Github here: https://github.com/ttollers/tomtoll/issues/new
- If you disagree, let me know on [https://twitter.com/tomtoll_eth/status/1592907007001956352?s=20](twitter)

Strong opinions, weakly held and all that...

### Quantity Over Quality
I'm a perfectionist.
More often than not, this means no content rather than actual perfection.

On this site, I will go against my instincts and just publish.
Where I get feedback, I'll update and improve for next time.

### Chat GPT
I'm lazy, dyslexic (at least I got the qualification to prove it when I was younger) and generally a poor writer.
For your sake, I will use every tool available to help me. That includes Chat GPT.
However, I'll *italicise* any text that's been generated entirely by Chat GPT.

This is me. I'm lazy and a lousy writer.

*Yes, it's me, ChatGPT! How may I assist you today?*
