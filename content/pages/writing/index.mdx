### Strong opinions weakly held
I try to live by this in all parts of my life.
I've even written [a post about it](/strong-opinions-weakly-held).
This means:
- I may express ignorant opinions
- I **want** to be told when I'm wrong

### Feedback
I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't solicit some feedback:
- If there's an error, please create an issue on Github here: https://github.com/ttollers/tomtoll/issues/new
- If you disagree, let me know on [https://twitter.com/tomtollinton](twitter)

Strong opinions, weakly held and all that...

### Quantity over quality
I'm a perfectionist.
This means no content rather than actual perfection.

On this site, I will go against my instincts and just publish stuff.
Where I get feedback, I'll update and improve for next time.

### WIP
On the subject of perfectionism, I post WIP (Work in Progress) posts.

You won't see them listed in the "Posts" section, but you can [find them here](/tags/wip).

These posts will be rough and unpolished - a place for early feedback.
It's part of my psychological strategy to defeat perfectionism and get things out faster.

### Chat GPT
I'm lazy, (apparently) dyslexic and an inexperienced writer.
For your sake, I will use every tool available to help me. That includes Chat GPT.
However, I'll *italicise* any text that's been generated by Chat GPT.

This is me. I'm lazy and a lousy writer.

*Yes, it's me, ChatGPT! How may I assist you today?*
