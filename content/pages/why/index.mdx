I'm not a good writer.
I can say that with confidence because I haven't done it much.
So why do I write?

### It's a valuable skill
I want to be a better Engineering Leader.
Whatever the industry, written communication is essential for leadership.
This will only increase in the world of remote work.
I'm a novice writer - I want to practice, get feedback and improve it.

### Face my fear
I want to contribute, but I'm scared of failing - and I hate that.
As I mention in [this post](/dunning-kruger-the-dunning-kruger), fears like this mean the overly-confident ignorant can be louder than their more knowledgeable "imposters".

I like the policy of "regret minimisation".
If I try and fail, my regret will quickly be replaced by lessons learned and a desire to try again.
If I don't write, I'll always regret not trying.

> Contribute, iterate, repeat > fear, give up repeat.

### Writing helps me think
While looking for inspiration, the following quote strongly resonated ([from this post](https://fs.blog/why-write/)).

> Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand what you are talking about.

I often put the world to rights in the shower only to realise just how flawed my logic is when I write it down.
It's likely saved me from looking like an idiot on many occasions.

### I'm developing an Identity
For better or worse, I've been developing an identity in the world of Engineering and Leadership.
By Identity, I mean what makes me a bit different.

What this means can't be explained or defined in a few words.
I want a place where colleagues, investors, interviewers and interviewees can better understand who I am when they meet me.

### I have a unique perspective
Building from the previous point, the world is a richer and more colourful place when more perspectives are shared.

Of course, I say that as a white, middle-class, male in Software Engineering.
I'll let you decide on the value of my perspective.


### I'm NOT here for...
Money. There will be no subscriptions / paywalls / ads / affiliate links.

Shilling.
